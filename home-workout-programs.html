    <h1>Best Home Workout Programs</h1>
    <h2>Workout Programs that I have used personally</h2>
    <p>Not everyone likes or has time to go to the gym.  Luckily, there are many workout program that you can do at home in the comfort of your own living room.</p>
    <p>All you need is an internet connection, and a laptop (or a TV with a <b>Roku</b> player).</p>

      <li><b><a href="https://www.beachbody.com/">Beachbody</a></b></li>
        <img src="img/focus-t25.jpg" alt = "Focus T25 Workout Program Video Still" width="300"/>
        <p>Beachbody has been around for a long time, and I love them because they have so many different workout programs to choose from.  Their Beachbody on Demand service is affordable at around $3.50 per week paid quarterly.</p>
      <li><b><a href="https://dailyburn.com">Daily Burn</a></b></li>
        <img src="img/daily-burn.jpg" alt = "Daily Burn Workout Program Video Still" width = "300"/>
        <p>I joined Daily Burn because I am interested in their dance workouts since I love to dance.  However, they have another program that caught my attention where it monitors your heart rate so that you can get the most out of the workout program.  It's a monthly subscription for about $13 monthly.</p>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.lesmillsondemand.com/en_us/?c">Les Mills on Demand</a></b></li>
        <img src="img/les-mills-pump.jpg" alt = "Les Mills Pump Video Program Still" width = "300"/>
        <p>I really like Les Mills pump because of their Body Pump and Combat programs.  It is also convenient that these programs are available on a Roku player.  It's a monthly subscription for about $10 monthly.</p>
      <li><b>YouTube</b></li>
        <p>YouTube is perfect for the person that really doesn't have the money to invest in a workout program.  Here are some of my favorite channels on YouTube:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFitnessMarshall">The Fitness Marshall</a></b></li>
          <img src="img/the-fitness-marshall.jpg" alt= "Photo of The Fitness Marshall" width="300"/>
          <p>I like these workouts because they are short and easy to follow.</p>
          <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mattsteffanina">Matt Steffanina</a></b></li>
          <img src="img/matt-steffanina.jpg" alt="Photo of Matt Steffanina and another dancer." width="300"/>
          <p>For complex dance routines, he's the best.  Plus he also has free tutorials for most of his routines.</p>
          <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/superherofitnesstv">SuperHeroFitnessTV</a></b></li>
          <img src="img/keaira-lashae.jpg" alt="Photo of Keaira LaShae Dance Workout" width="300"/>
          <p>Keaira LaShae has so many free dance workouts on her YouTube channel, that you almost don't need to pay for her paid membership.</p>
          <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fitnessblender">FitnessBlender</a></b></li>
          <img src="img/fitness-blender.png" alt="Video still of Fitness Blender Workout" width="300"/>
          <p>For those that aren't into dance workouts, Fitness Blender is really good.</p>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>What's awesome about all of these options is that they are available for viewing from your laptop or your TV using the internet and a <b>Roku</b> player.  That means that you can take them anywhere...even to the gym!</p>
    <p>I've listed a workout program for every budget.  I hope that you found something that you like.</p>
